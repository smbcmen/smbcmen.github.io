I started reading a new book, [Family Discipleship: Leading Your Home through Time, Moments, and Milestones by Matt Chandler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/143356629X/) and it has really spoken to me.

Check out these quotes from the text.

**First paragraph of the introduction**:

> "Children are immeasurably valuable. You, a parent, are the guardian of an immortal soul, a cherished human being, an incalculable treasure, the very image of God himself. When it comes to parenting, sometimes you get to enjoy it and sometimes you have to endure it. It is wonderful and unpredictable. It is the most fun, upsetting, messy, beautiful, disappointing, and encouraging position in the world. Raising kids is an endlessly challenging adventure, and it comes with a never-ending list of responsibilities. One of the grandest of those responsibilities is the call to all parents to be disciple-makers in their own homes. A disciplemaker is a follower of Christ helping others follow Christ. No matter what your household looks like, your family is the primary instrument and environment for discipleship in all the fantastic and flawed ways that it might be worked out. Your persevering and often thankless spiritual leadership in your home is one of the most important things you will ever do with your life."


**...and this section from the Foreword**:

 
> "Parenting can put us into a fog, rendering many of us in survival mode, ready to pronounce any day in which everyone makes it to bedtime alive as a raging success. But we know in our hearts that more is required of us than survival.  We cannot afford to simply make it through the day. Those survival days have a way of turning into weeks, and into months and years. Before we know it, opportunities to point our children toward faith in meaningful ways have fallen to the wayside in favor of just getting by."
> "But Christian parents want to be those who wisely steward the season of raising children. Psalm 90:12 says, “Teach us to number our days / that we may get a heart of wisdom.” We want to be good at numbering these precious days."


Some days, as a Dad, I just feel like I'm treading water until everyone is asleep, when I can finally breath and I don't want that. I want more, I need to do more. So I'm going to keep reading it and try to put some of the principals into practice. Talking with men, this seems to be a common theme of something they struggle with or had previously.

So I'd like to invite ya'll to join me in a Men's Book and Bible Study on Fridays over lunch (maybe outside at Pruett's?). I was considering meeting every two weeks for an hour and a half - get some lunch, fellowship, then discuss the reading. Once we finish this we could move onto another book and once it's nice outside we could even meet on my back patio on occasion.
