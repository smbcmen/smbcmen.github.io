## Mens 517 Bible Study
We meet the second and fourth Tuesday of each month. Soft drinks, coffee, and tea are provided. Occasionally someone will bring a snack

Recently we started the book of James and we start at 8 pm... ish.  

We pray, read some verses, and sometimes talk about the moon landing or predestination vs free will for no really good reason.  

If this sounds interesting to you, we would love for you to join us.  If you have any questions, feel free to reach out for more details.
