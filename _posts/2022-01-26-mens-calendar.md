Would you like to integrate the Men's Ministry Google Calendar with your own Google Calendar suite? The following will help you do so.

## Step 1

Use the following link to "add" the calendar to your group of calendars: [ADD](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=NnFubnVwa3FtNDluZDY1NDlpY2U4azRzNzBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)

Note: This will not add all the events to your personal calender but rather add a new calendar to your group of calendars in Google. This is best practice as it allows you to hide and unhide all events by calendar if you choose.

## Step 2

In the pop-up window click "Add"

## Step 3

You're done!!

Now in the bottom left hand corner of your Google Calendar you can see your list of calendars and the SMBC Men's Ministry calendar should be there!
