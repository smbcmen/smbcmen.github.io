### Our Foundation
**JourneyWITH- Incarnation**
God with us and us with Him. Us with one another. SMBC standing with you (equipping) as a man in a nourishing, discipleship environment as you live your daily life. 

(John 1:14; John 17:22)

_Learning to LIVE...in holy relating with Trinity and with each other._

**ProcessWITH- Discern**
Solid food is for the mature who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil. Valuing the work of God’s Holy Spirit to help us as our counselor in living life with each other.

(Hebrews 5:14; John 14:26)

_Learning to PROCESS..in the celebration and grieving of daily living with Trinity and with each other._

**ChangeWITH-Transformation**
God graciously forms us into little “Christs” by detaching us from second things and attaching us to
first things. Us all being formed together breeds an environment of compassion as we all celebrate
and struggle in our learning and growing. 

(Galatians 4:19; Matthew 11:28-30)

_Learning to GROW..."All of my weakness is met by Your grace, the empowering presence to change; I bow low at the feet of my Savior, saying yes to the process of changing.”_
